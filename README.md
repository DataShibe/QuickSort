# QuickSort 

This is a program, to sort arrays with the QuickSort Algorithm. The Algorithm is optimized to be quick, but it isn't the fastest. I have written this Program in C because C is pretty fast, coming in handy when writing algorithms. If you want to find out more about Sorting Algorithms and QuickSort then those articles are the best for you.

You can use this code in your programs if you are too lazy to write the Algorithm yourself.
